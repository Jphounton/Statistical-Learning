Our study aims to explore the wealth of a number of indicators in order to find out a model to predict the price range of mobile phone. To do this, a first step will be data processing. Indeed we will proceed to univariate and bivariate studies of our variables, in order to better understand the data we have. In a second step we will propose different models to fit the price range and finally, we will be able to predict the price range based on the available explanatory features.

To do this, the 3 main models we will use are: * Logistic Regression * kNN * CART
